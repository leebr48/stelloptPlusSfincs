# stelloptPlusSfincs
Scripts for making STELLOPT and SFINCS work nicely together.

## Installation

Set the environment variable (preferably permanently, such as in your `.bashrc` file) `SFINCS_PATH=path/to/sfincs/repo`. If you want to receive job updates from Slurm, also set `SFINCS_BATCH_EMAIL=your_email@website.com` in the same way.

# FIXME talk about the python packages needed to run this (keeping the standard library packages in mind)

# FIXME should this be a python package?... Would that mess up the top-level wrapper scripts?

## Use

See what this repo can do at the moment by running any of the scripts in the main directory with the `--help` flag.

# FIXME mention which version of SFINCS this code can be used with

# FIXME explain how the input profiles have to be right, and give details about what SFINCS takes as input in general
