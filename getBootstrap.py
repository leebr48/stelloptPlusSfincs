# Given pressure and toroidal flux information from a VMEC wout_* file and bootstrap information from a SFINCS directory,
# this script will calculate the "correct" bootstrap current for the given magnetic configuration. This could be used, for
# instance, to refine an optimized configuration until the bootstrap is self-consistent. The information is output in STELLOPT
# format so it can be used with VMEC. Please note that to get an accurate picture of the bootstrap current inside a stellarator,
# one must formally integrate neoclassically-derived quantities from the magnetic axis to the last closed flux surface. SFINCS
# should therefore be run over as much of the volume as possible. Polynomial extrapolation will be used to "fill in the ends" 
# since SFINCS is not typically run too close to the magnetic axis, and is often not run too close to the last closed flux surface
# either.
# This script numerically integrates equation (17) in "Computing vmecâ€™s ac current profile and curtor from a bootstrap current code"
# by Matt Landreman, which is included in the STELLOPT directory in SHARE/doc/computing_vmec_AC_profile_from_a_bootstrap_current_code.
# The results of this script should be fairly accurate - they are within a few percent of the results in https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0098166,
# for instance, but the source of the discrepancy is not known.
